## Educational SQL Examples

**⚠️ Important: These are simplified educational examples created for learning database design concepts. They are NOT LinkedIn's actual database schema.**

**Learning Objective:** Understand how to translate entity models into SQL table structures.

```sql
-- Educational Example: Users table structure
-- Learning Focus: Primary keys, data types, constraints
CREATE TABLE Users (
    UserID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,           -- Auto-incrementing primary key pattern
    Name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,          -- Required field with length constraint
    Email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,  -- Unique constraint for authentication
    Headline VARCHAR(255),               -- Optional professional summary
    Summary TEXT,                        -- Long-form text field for detailed content
    ProfilePicture VARCHAR(255),         -- External file reference pattern
    RegistrationDate DATE NOT NULL       -- Temporal data for user lifecycle tracking
);

-- Educational Example: Network connections table
-- Learning Focus: Foreign key relationships, self-referencing tables
CREATE TABLE Connections (
    ConnectionID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,     -- Surrogate key for relationship entities
    UserID INT NOT NULL,                 -- Foreign key to Users table
    ConnectedUserID INT NOT NULL,        -- Self-referencing foreign key pattern
    ConnectionDate DATE NOT NULL,        -- Temporal relationship data
    CONSTRAINT FK_User FOREIGN KEY (UserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID),
    CONSTRAINT FK_ConnectedUser FOREIGN KEY (ConnectedUserID) REFERENCES Users(UserID)
);

-- Educational Example: Job postings table
-- Learning Focus: Multi-tenant design patterns
CREATE TABLE Jobs (
    JobID SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,            -- Primary key for content entities
    EmployerID INT NOT NULL,              -- Links to user who created the job
    Title VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,          -- Searchable content field
    Description TEXT,                     -- Long-form content storage
    Location VARCHAR(255),                -- Geographic data for filtering
    PostDate DATE NOT NULL,               -- Content lifecycle tracking
    CONSTRAINT FK_Employer FOREIGN KEY (EmployerID) REFERENCES Users(UserID)
);
```
